# Fine-Tuning a Local LLM with PEFT and GPT-4o Assistance

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a high-quality dataset for fine-tuning a local text-based LLM (Large Language Model) using **public LLM training datasets** and **GPT-4o** as an evaluator and supplementer. The fine-tuning process employs **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to efficiently update the model using adapter weights.

### Key Features:
- **Prompt Generation**: Extracts prompts from public datasets such as SQuAD.
- **Response Generation**: Uses the local LLM to generate responses for the prompts.
- **Evaluation and Supplementation**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o to evaluate the quality of responses and provide improved responses when necessary.
- **PEFT Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tunes the local LLM using LoRA for efficient adaptation.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies:
- `transformers`: For working with Hugging Face models.
- `datasets`: For loading public datasets like SQuAD.
- `peft`: For implementing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA).
- `openai`: For interacting with OpenAI's GPT-4o API.
- `torch`: For PyTorch-based model training.
- `accelerate`: For efficient multi-GPU training.

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the Environment
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key by replacing `"your_openai_api_key"` in the script with your actual API key.

### 2. Run the Program
Execute the Python script to:
1. Load prompts from public datasets.
2. Generate responses using your local LLM.
3. Evaluate and supplement low-quality responses with GPT-4o.
4. Fine-tune your local LLM using PEFT.

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```


### 3. Outputs
- **Dataset File**: A JSONL file (`final_dataset.jsonl`) containing high-quality prompt-response pairs.
- **Fine-Tuned Model**: The fine-tuned version of your local LLM saved in the `./peft_fine_tuned_model` directory.

## Example Workflow

1. Prompts are extracted from public datasets like SQuAD.
2. The local LLM generates responses for each prompt.
3. GPT-4o evaluates responses and supplements them when necessary.
4. The final dataset is used to fine-tune the local LLM using LoRA.

## Ethical Considerations

1. Ensure compliance with licensing terms of public datasets used for generating prompts.
2. Avoid generating sensitive or private information during supplementation.
3. Clearly document sources and methods used in creating the new dataset.

---

## Future Work

1. Extend prompt generation to include more diverse public datasets (e.g., The Pile, RedPajama).
2. Experiment with other PEFT techniques beyond LoRA for fine-tuning.
3. Evaluate the fine-tuned model on specific benchmarks to measure improvements.
